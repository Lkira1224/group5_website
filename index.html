      <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The history of League of Legends esports began with the game's launch in 2009 by Riot Games. It started with grassroots tournaments and community-driven events, but as the game's popularity grew, Riot Games established a more structured competitive framework. The first official League of Legends World Championship, known as the Season 1 Championship, took place in 2010, marking a significant milestone for the game. Over the years, the competitive scene expanded with the introduction of regional leagues like LCS and LEC, and the annual World Championship became a global spectacle. Riot Games also implemented franchising models and introduced events like the Mid-Season Invitational. League of Legends esports has experienced tremendous growth, becoming one of the most prominent and popular esports titles globally.
